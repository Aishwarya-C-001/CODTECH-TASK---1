Task 1 - Containerize a web application using Docker and deploy it to
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This project helps you
understand containerization and orchestration.

Objectives
This project focuses on:

1.Containerization with Docker

Package the web application along with its dependencies into a Docker container.
Ensure the application runs consistently across different systems.

2.Building and Pushing Docker Image

Create a Docker image of the application.
Push the image to a container registry (e.g., Google Container Registry).

3.Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster on GKE

Create and configure a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Understand cluster management and resource allocation.

4.Deploying the Application on GKE

Deploy the containerized application to GKE using Kubernetes manifests (YAML files).
Configure pods, services, and deployments for high availability.

5.Load Balancing and Autoscaling

Implement a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic.
Set up autoscaling to handle varying workloads automatically.

6.Monitoring and Logging

Enable monitoring tools like Google Cloud Operations for logs and performance insights.

Summary
This project focuses on containerizing a web application using Docker and deploying it to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to address challenges like dependency conflicts, scalability, and portability.

Key Steps Involved:

Containerization: Package the application and its dependencies into a Docker container.
Push Image to Registry: Upload the Docker image to Google Container Registry (GCR).
Kubernetes Setup: Create and configure a Kubernetes cluster on GKE.
Deployment: Deploy the containerized application using Kubernetes manifests.
Scalability and Reliability: Configure autoscaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
Monitoring: Enable logging and performance monitoring with Google Cloud tools.

Outcome
By completing this project, you'll gain:

Practical Knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes: Hands-on experience with containerization and orchestration.
Cloud Deployment Skills: Ability to deploy applications in cloud environments using GKE.
Scalability and Reliability Techniques: Implement strategies to manage high traffic and fault tolerance effectively.
Modern DevOps Practices: Learn CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes workflows to streamline deployments.

Task 2 - Host a static website using Google Cloud Storage. This project
involves creating a simple HTML/CSS website and deploying it
to Google Cloud.


Explanation
Hosting a static website on Google Cloud Storage allows you to deploy a fast, secure, and cost-effective website without managing servers. Google Cloud Storage acts as a scalable object storage service, ideal for serving static content such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files.

Google Cloud Storage?

Scalability: Handles high traffic seamlessly.
Cost-Effective: Pay only for storage and bandwidth used.
Simplicity: No need for server managementâ€”just upload files.
Security: Integrated with Identity and Access Management (IAM) for granular permissions.
Global Accessibility: Content can be cached using Cloud CDN for faster delivery worldwide.

Objectives

1.Create and Configure a Static Website:

Develop a simple website using HTML and CSS.

2.Set Up Google Cloud Storage Bucket:

Create a storage bucket with a globally unique name.
Enable public access for the bucket to make it accessible via the web.

3.Upload Website Files:

Upload HTML, CSS, and other assets to the storage bucket.

4.Configure Bucket as a Static Website Host:

Set the bucket to serve static content by defining index.html as the main page and 404.html for errors.

5.Test and Verify Deployment:

Access the website using the public URL provided by Google Cloud.

6.Optional Enhancements:

Enable Cloud CDN for faster content delivery.
Add SSL/TLS Certificates for HTTPS support.
Set up custom domain mapping for a professional look.

Summary

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website using Google Cloud Storage. It covers the creation of HTML/CSS files, setting up storage buckets, configuring public access, and testing the deployment. Optional features like CDN integration, custom domains, and SSL certificates enhance performance and security.

Outcome

1.Learn to create and deploy static websites without managing servers.
2.Gain experience with Google Cloud Storage and IAM permissions.
3.Understand how to configure public access and set up a custom domain.
4.Acquire knowledge of optimizing websites for performance using Cloud CDN.
5.Build confidence in deploying scalable and cost-effective web applications on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
