Task 1 - Containerize a web application using Docker and deploy it to
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This project helps you
understand containerization and orchestration.

Objectives
This project focuses on:

1.Containerization with Docker

Package the web application along with its dependencies into a Docker container.
Ensure the application runs consistently across different systems.

2.Building and Pushing Docker Image

Create a Docker image of the application.
Push the image to a container registry (e.g., Google Container Registry).

3.Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster on GKE

Create and configure a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Understand cluster management and resource allocation.

4.Deploying the Application on GKE

Deploy the containerized application to GKE using Kubernetes manifests (YAML files).
Configure pods, services, and deployments for high availability.

5.Load Balancing and Autoscaling

Implement a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic.
Set up autoscaling to handle varying workloads automatically.

6.Monitoring and Logging

Enable monitoring tools like Google Cloud Operations for logs and performance insights.

Summary
This project focuses on containerizing a web application using Docker and deploying it to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to address challenges like dependency conflicts, scalability, and portability.

Key Steps Involved:

Containerization: Package the application and its dependencies into a Docker container.
Push Image to Registry: Upload the Docker image to Google Container Registry (GCR).
Kubernetes Setup: Create and configure a Kubernetes cluster on GKE.
Deployment: Deploy the containerized application using Kubernetes manifests.
Scalability and Reliability: Configure autoscaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
Monitoring: Enable logging and performance monitoring with Google Cloud tools.

Outcome
By completing this project, you'll gain:

Practical Knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes: Hands-on experience with containerization and orchestration.
Cloud Deployment Skills: Ability to deploy applications in cloud environments using GKE.
Scalability and Reliability Techniques: Implement strategies to manage high traffic and fault tolerance effectively.
Modern DevOps Practices: Learn CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes workflows to streamline deployments.
